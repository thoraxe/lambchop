# Lambchop
Lambchop is a tool that can be used to output Puppet DSL for an arbitrary file
on the local filesystem. When given the proper options, it can also output the
correct Puppet DSL SELinux stanzas.

# Future
1. Take more than one file as input.
2. Output the complete structure for a Puppet module and turn the input file(s).
3. Package the resulting Puppet module.
